        J.R.R. Tolkien, in full John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (born January 3, 1892, Bloemfontein, South Africa—died
        September 2, 1973, Bournemouth, Hampshire, England), English
        writer and scholar who achieved fame with his children’s book The Hobbit (1937) and his richly inventive epic
        fantasy The Lord of the Rings (1954–55).At age four Tolkien, with his mother and younger brother, settled near
        Birmingham, England, after his father, a bank manager, died in South Africa. In 1900 his mother converted to
        Roman Catholicism, a faith her elder son also practiced devoutly. On her death in 1904, her boys became wards of
        a Catholic priest. Four years later Tolkien fell in love with another orphan, Edith Bratt, who would inspire his
        fictional character Lúthien Tinúviel. His guardian, however, disapproved, and not until his 21st birthday could
        Tolkien ask Edith to marry him. In the meantime, he attended King Edward’s School in Birmingham and Exeter
        College, Oxford (B.A., 1915; M.A., 1919). During World War I he saw action in the Somme. After the Armistice he
        was briefly on the staff of The Oxford English Dictionary (then called The New English Dictionary).

        <br> For most of his adult life, he taught English language and literature, specializing in Old and Middle English,
        at the Universities of Leeds (1920–25) and Oxford (1925–59). Often busy with academic duties and also acting as
        an examiner for other universities, he produced few but influential scholarly publications, notably a standard
        edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (1925; with E.V. Gordon) and a landmark lecture on Beowulf (Beowulf:
        The Monsters and the Critics, 1936). Tolkien had completed a translation of Beowulf in 1926, and it was
        posthumously published, along with classroom lectures he had given on the subject, some of his notes, and an
        original short story inspired by the legend, as Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary (2014). He also published
        an edition of the Ancrene Wisse (1962). In private, Tolkien amused himself by writing an elaborate series of
        fantasy tales, often dark and sorrowful, set in a world of his own creation. He made this “legendarium,” which
        eventually became The Silmarillion, partly to provide a setting in which “Elvish” languages he had invented
        could exist. But his tales of Arda and Middle-earth also grew from a desire to tell stories, influenced by a
        love of myths and legends. To entertain his four children, he devised lighter fare, lively and often humorous.
        The longest and most important of those stories, begun about 1930, was The Hobbit, a coming-of-age fantasy about
        a comfort-loving “hobbit” (a smaller relative of Man) who joins a quest for a dragon’s treasure. In 1937 The
        Hobbit was published, with pictures by the author (an accomplished amateur artist), and was so popular that its
        publisher asked for a sequel. The result, 17 years later, was Tolkien’s masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, a
        modern version of the heroic epic. A few elements from The Hobbit were carried over, in particular a magic ring,
        now revealed to be the One Ring, which must be destroyed before it can be used by the terrible Dark Lord,
        Sauron, to rule the world. But The Lord of the Rings is also an extension of Tolkien’s Silmarillion tales, which
        gave the new book a “history” in which Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and Men were already established.
