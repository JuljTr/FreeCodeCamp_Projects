                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what
                    you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make
                    content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with
                    background images and colors?</p>

                <header class="header">What is CSS?</header>
                <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style
                    sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS
                    selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:</p>
                <code class="code"> p {color: red;} </code>

                <p>Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save
                    the file as <code class="style">style.css</code> in a directory named styles. </p>
                <p>To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise,
                    the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project,
                    pause here to read Dealing with files and HTML basics.)</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head (between the head and /head tags):</li>
                  <p> <code class="code">link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" </code>   </p>
                    <li>Save index.html and load it in your browser.If your paragraph text is red, congratulations!
                        Your CSS is working.</li>
                </ol>

            <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy of a CSS ruleset">
                <header class="header">Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</header>
                <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works.
                    The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note
                    the names of the individual parts: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selector <p>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s)
                            to be styled (in this example, elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Declaration <p>This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's
                            properties you want to style.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties <p>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is
                            a property of the elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the
                            rule.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Property value <p>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This
                            chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are
                            many color values in addition to red.)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
                    <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
                    <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or
                        values.</li>
                    <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next
                        one.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:</p>

                <code class="code">p {color: red; width: 500px; border: 1px solid black;}</code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Selecting multiple elements">
                <header class="header">Selecting multiple elements</header>

                <p>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate
                    multiple selectors by commas. For example:</p>
                <code class="code">p, li, h1 { color: red; }</code>

            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Different types of selectors">
                <header class="header">Different types of selectors</header>
                <p>There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which
                    select all elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here are
                    some of the more common types of selectors:</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Selector name</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>ID selector</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Class selector</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Attribute selector</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Pseudo-class selector</td>
                    </tr>

                </table>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Fonts and text">
                <header class="header">Fonts and text</header>
                <p>Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the appearance of the example by adding
                    more rules and information to the style.css file.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously saved from What will your website
                        look like?. Add the
                        <link> element somewhere inside your index.html's head (anywhere between the

                        <head> and </head> tags).
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, delete the existing rule you have in your style.css file. It was a good test, but let's
                        not continue with lots of red text. </li>
                    <li>Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the font-family assignment with your
                        font-family selection from What will your website look like?. The property font-family refers to
                        the font(s) you want to use for text. This rule defines a global base font and font size for the
                        whole page. Since <html> is the parent element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit
                        the same font-size and font-family.</li>
                    <li>Now let's set font sizes for elements that will have text inside the HTML body (h1, li, and p).
                        We'll also center the heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset (below) with settings
                        for line height and letter spacing to make body content more readable.</li>

                </ol>

            <section class="main-section" id="CSS: all about boxes">
                <header class="header">CSS: all about boxes</header>
                <p>Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size,
                    color, and position. Most HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of
                    other boxes.</p>
                <p>CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties
                    like:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the
                        paragraph text.</li>
                    <li>border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
                    <li>margin, the space around the outside of the border.</li>
                </ul>
